  What is it about?

%p
  Togglz is an implementation of the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">Feature Toggles</a> pattern for Java.
  Feature Toggles are a very common agile development practices in the context of continuous deployment and delivery.
  The basic idea is to associate a toggle with each new feature you are working on. This allows you to enable or disable these
  features at application runtime, even for individual users.

      Togglz session on gearconf 2012
    .content
      My Togglz session on <a href="http://gearconf.com/">gearconf 2012</a> was a huge success. I got awesome feedback

      <a href="https://vimeo.com/45076301">video</a> (both in German).

  Why should you choose Togglz?

%p
  %b
    Because Togglz...
  
%ul
  %li
    allows you to declare your features using a regular Java enum type.
  %li
    is configured in a type-safe way by implementing a single interface.
  %li
    provides integration with popular frameworks like CDI, Spring, JSF, etc.
  %li
    supports different backends for storing toggle states (JDBC database, Java property files, etc)
  %li
    can be integrated with your user identity management which allows to enable features only for specific users.
  %li
    integrates with common security frameworks like JAAS, Spring Security, Seam Security and Apache Shiro. 
  %li
    supports complex application packaging scenarios like EARs, skinny WARs, etc.
  %li
    ships with an embedded web-based admin console to manage feature states. 

%h2
  Example
  
%p
  Features are declared using a regular Java enum type:
  
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public enum MyFeatures implements Feature {
    
        @Label("First Feature")
        FEATURE_ONE,
        
        @Label("Second Feature")
        FEATURE_TWO;
        
        public boolean isActive() {
            return FeatureContext.getFeatureManager().isActive(this);
        }
        
    }

%p
  Checking whether a specific feature is enabled for the current user is very simple. Just call the <code>isActive()</code>
  method on the feature.

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public void someBusinessMethod() {
    
      if( MyFeatures.FEATURE_ONE.isActive() ) {
        // do new exciting stuff here
      }

      [...]
      
    }
